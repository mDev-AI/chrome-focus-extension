# YouTube Focus Fortress Icons

This directory contains the icon assets for the YouTube Focus Fortress Chrome extension.

## Icon Files

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon

## Generating Icons

To regenerate the PNG icons from the SVG source:

1. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the icon generator:
   ```
   npm run generate
   ```

This will create the PNG files needed for the extension from the SVG definitions.

## Icon Design

The icons represent a "Focus Fortress" with:

- A blue shield (representing protection from distractions)
- A red circle (representing YouTube)
- A focus eye symbol (representing focused viewing)

The icons are used in the Chrome extension toolbar, extension management page, and other places where the extension is displayed.
